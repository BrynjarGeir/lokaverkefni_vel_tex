\chapter*{Appendix A: Feature importance on Shapley plots}
\label{appendix:A}

In section \ref{sec:shapley}, the Shapley values were used to investigate the feature importance of the neural network. Summary plots were created to visualize the feature importance of the model, along with one waterfall plot to show how features for an individual prediction influenced the model prediction. More summary plots were created than were displayed in section \ref{sec:shapley}, those plots are displayed here.
